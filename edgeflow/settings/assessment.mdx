Assessment settings control how EdgeFlow conducts VMSWO and conjugate assessments. Configure these to match your research protocol.

## Accessing Settings

Navigate to **Settings** > **Assessment** to view and modify these options.

## VMSWO Settings

### Block Configuration

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Number of Blocks | 3 | 1-5 | How many VMSWO blocks per session |
| Counterbalancing | Circular rotation | Fixed, Random, Circular | How stimulus order varies across blocks |

<Note>
The standard VMSWO methodology uses 3 blocks with circular rotation. Only change these if your protocol specifically requires different parameters.
</Note>

### Timing

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instruction Duration | 5 seconds | How long instructions display before starting |
| Block Transition Duration | 3 seconds | Pause between blocks |

---

## Conjugate Settings

### Trial Parameters

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trial Duration | 30 seconds | 10-120 sec | Maximum length per stimulus trial |
| Unlimited Duration | Off | On/Off | Allow trials to run until manually ended |

### Clarity Mechanic

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Clarity | 100% | 50-100% | Starting clarity when stimulus appears |
| Fade Rate | 10%/sec | 5-20%/sec | How quickly clarity decreases |
| Force-to-Clarity Ratio | 10:1 | 5-20:1 | Clarity units restored per kg of force |
| Minimum Clarity | 10% | 0-50% | Clarity floor (never goes below this) |

<Tip>
Lower fade rates and higher force ratios make the task easier. Adjust based on participant capabilities and your research goals.
</Tip>

### Inter-Trial Interval (ITI)

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ITI Duration | 3 seconds | 2-10 sec | Rest period between trials |
| Show Countdown | On | On/Off | Display countdown timer during ITI |
| Allow Manual Skip | Off | On/Off | Let researcher skip remaining ITI |

---

## Presentation Order

Control the order stimuli are presented during conjugate phase:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| VMSWO-Ranked | Present in order of VMSWO preference (HP first) |
| Quasi-Random | Randomized with constraints (no repeats) |
| Counterbalanced | Systematic rotation across participants |
| Fully Random | Completely randomized order |

<Note>
For Full Protocol sessions, VMSWO-Ranked order allows evaluation of whether participants apply more force early (when HP stimuli appear) vs. late (LP stimuli).
</Note>

## Researcher Information

Stored with each session for documentation:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Researcher Name | Name of person conducting sessions |
| Institution | Organization or facility name |
| Contact Email | Contact for data inquiries |
| IRB Protocol Number | Ethics approval reference |

---

## Per-Session Overrides

Most settings can be overridden when creating a session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Session Setup">
    Begin the session creation wizard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Advanced Options">
    Click **Advanced Options** before launching.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify Settings">
    Change any parameters for this session only.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    The session uses your overrides; defaults remain unchanged.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resetting to Defaults

To restore all assessment settings to defaults:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Assessment**
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click **Reset to Defaults**
4. Confirm the reset

<Warning>
This resets all assessment settings. Per-session overrides on existing sessions are not affected.
</Warning>
