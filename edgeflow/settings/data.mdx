Data management settings control how EdgeFlow stores, backs up, and maintains your research data.

## Accessing Settings

Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Management** to view and modify these options.

## Database Location

### Default Location

EdgeFlow stores its encrypted database in the application data directory:

| Platform | Default Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/EdgeFlow/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\EdgeFlow\` |
| Linux | `~/.config/EdgeFlow/` |

### Custom Location

To use a custom database location:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Data Management">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Management**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Change Location">
    Click **Change Database Location**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Folder">

    Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Management**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Restore">
    Click **Restore from Backup**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Backup">
    Choose from available backup files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Restoration">
    Review the backup date and confirm. Current data will be replaced.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart">
    EdgeFlow restarts with the restored data.

## Data Retention

### Retention Policy

| Setting | Default | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Retention | Keep Forever | Forever / 30-365 days | How long to keep session data |

<Note>
When a retention period is set, sessions older than the specified period are automatically deleted. Backups are not affected by retention policies.
</Note>

### Before Enabling Retention

Consider:

- Your IRB data retention requirements
- Whether you've exported all needed data
- Backup availability for long-term storage

---

## Storage Statistics

## Maintenance

### Database Optimization

Over time, the database may benefit from optimization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Data Management">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Management**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Optimize">
    Click **Optimize Database**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Completion">
    Optimization runs (may take several minutes for large databases).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Optimization:
- Reclaims space from deleted records
- Rebuilds indexes for faster queries
- May reduce database file size

### Clearing Test Data

To remove test participants and sessions:

1. Navigate to **Participants**
2. Delete test participants individually, or
3. Use **Settings** > **Data Management** > **Clear Test Data** for bulk removal

<Warning>
Clearing data is permanent. Ensure you've exported any needed records first.
