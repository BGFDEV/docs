This guide walks you through running your first VMSWO preference assessment in EdgeFlow. By the end, you'll have a participant with completed assessment data.

<Info>
This quick start covers VMSWO-only assessment. For conjugate reinforcement assessments, you'll need Arduino hardware configured first. See [Hardware Setup](/edgeflow/hardware/requirements).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before starting:
- EdgeFlow is installed and database is initialized
- You have 5 stimulus images ready (JPG or PNG files)

## Step 1: Add Stimuli

First, upload your stimulus images to the library:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Stimulus Library">
    Navigate to **Settings**, then select **Stimuli** from the settings navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Images">
    Click **Add Stimuli** and select your 5 image files. Each image will be added to your library.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Stimulus Set">
    Click **Create Set**, name it (e.g., "Assessment Set 1"), and select exactly 5 stimuli from your library.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Stimulus sets must contain exactly 5 items. This is required by the VMSWO methodology for proper counterbalancing.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create a Participant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Participants">
    Navigate to **Participants** from the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add New Participant">
    Click **Add Participant** and enter an identifier (e.g., "Participant 001"). You can optionally add notes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Start a Session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Begin Session Setup">
    From the home screen, click **New Session** or navigate to the participant and click **Start Session**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Participant">
    Choose your participant from the dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Assessment Type">
    Select **VMSWO Only** for this quick start.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Stimulus Type">
    Choose **Image** (or Audio if you uploaded audio files).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Stimulus Set">
    Choose the stimulus set you created in Step 1.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Equipment Checklist">
    Verify the checklist items and proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Assessment">
    Click **Start Session** to open the participant assessment window.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Run the Assessment

The assessment opens in a separate window for the participant:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Instructions Screen">
    The participant sees task instructions. Click to proceed when ready.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Block 1">
    All 5 stimuli are presented. The participant indicates their most preferred. The selected stimulus is removed, and the remaining 4 are presented. This continues until all stimuli are ranked for the block.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blocks 2 and 3">
    The process repeats with counterbalanced stimulus ordering to control for sequence effects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completion">
    After 3 blocks, the session ends and results are saved automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: View Results

After the assessment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Sessions">
    Navigate to **Sessions** from the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Your Session">
    Locate the completed session in the list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Rankings">
    Click the session to see preference rankings, showing which stimuli were selected most and least frequently.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Results

The VMSWO results show:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Stimulus | The stimulus image/name |
| Rank | Overall preference rank (1 = most preferred) |
| Selection Count | How many times this stimulus was selected first |
| Block Rankings | Individual rank within each of the 3 blocks |

<Tip>
Stimuli ranked 1-2 are typically considered **high-preference (HP)**, while ranks 4-5 are **low-preference (LP)**. This classification is used in correspondence analysis.
