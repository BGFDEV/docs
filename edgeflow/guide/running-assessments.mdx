Once a session is launched, EdgeFlow guides you through the assessment procedure. This page covers what happens during each phase.

## The Two Windows

During an active session, EdgeFlow uses two windows:

| Window | Purpose | Audience |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Participant Window** | Assessment display and interaction | Participant |
| **Researcher Monitor** | Real-time feedback and controls | Researcher |

<Tip>
For best results, use a second monitor for the participant window. Position yourself where you can observe both screens.
</Tip>

## VMSWO Assessment

### Participant View

The participant sees:

1. **Instructions Screen**: Task explanation (configurable duration)
2. **Stimulus Array**: All 5 stimuli displayed
3. **Selection Prompt**: "Which one do you want most?"
4. **Block Transitions**: Brief screen between blocks

### Researcher Actions

During VMSWO, the researcher:

1. **Reads the prompt** to the participant (if verbal protocol)
2. **Records selection** when participant responds
3. **Observes behavior** and notes any issues

### Recording Selections

When the participant indicates a preference:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Participant Responds">
    The participant points, names, or otherwise indicates their choice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Selection">
    Click the corresponding stimulus in the participant window or use keyboard shortcuts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    The stimulus is removed and remaining stimuli are re-presented.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Keyboard Shortcuts (VMSWO)

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1-5 | Select stimulus in position 1-5 |
| Space | Advance instructions screen |
| Esc | Open end session dialog |

---

## Conjugate Assessment

### Participant View

The participant sees:

1. **Instructions Screen**: Task explanation
2. **Stimulus Display**: Single stimulus at configurable clarity
3. **Force Feedback**: Visual feedback as they grip (clarity changes)
4. **ITI Screen**: Rest period between trials

### The Force-Clarity Loop

During each trial:

1. Stimulus appears at 100% clarity
2. Clarity fades over time (configurable rate)
3. Participant gripping the dynamometer restores clarity
4. Higher force = more clarity restoration
5. Trial ends after configured duration

### Researcher Monitor

The researcher monitor shows:

| Panel | Information |
| --- | --- |
| Current Trial | Stimulus being presented, elapsed time |
| Force Reading | Real-time grip force (kg) |
| Force Graph | Live force over time for current trial |
| Clarity Level | Current stimulus clarity percentage |
| Trial Progress | How many trials completed / remaining |

### Researcher Actions

During conjugate, the researcher:

1. **Monitors hardware** to ensure force readings are capturing
2. **Observes participant** for fatigue or confusion
3. **Notes issues** in real-time if needed

<Note>
Conjugate trials run automatically. The researcher primarily observes rather than interacts.
</Note>

## Full Protocol Transitions

When running Full Protocol:

<Steps>
  <Step title="VMSWO Completes">
    After 3 VMSWO blocks, a transition screen appears.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conjugate Instructions">
    Instructions for the conjugate phase are displayed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conjugate Begins">
    Trials run through all stimuli based on configured order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session Ends">
    Completion screen displays, data is saved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Inter-Trial Intervals (ITI)

Between conjugate trials, an ITI provides rest:

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Duration | 2-10 seconds (configurable) |
| Display | Blank screen or countdown (configurable) |
| Manual Skip | Optionally allow researcher to skip ITI |

### Configuring ITI

Default ITI is 3 seconds. Adjust in **Settings** > **Assessment** or per-session before launch.

## Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Participant doesn't understand instructions">
    Use the instructions screen time to demonstrate. You can re-read instructions verbally. If persistent confusion, consider practice trials (create a test session first).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Participant changes their mind during VMSWO">
    If they haven't clicked yet, let them reconsider. If already selected, note it but continue—the procedure doesn't allow take-backs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Force readings are erratic">
    Check dynamometer grip and cable connection. If readings spike or drop unexpectedly, the session may need to restart after troubleshooting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Participant shows signs of fatigue">
    Note the observation. Consider shorter trial durations in future sessions. If severe, you may end the session early (partial data is saved).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Ending a Session

### Normal Completion

When all phases complete:

1. Completion screen displays summary
2. Data saves automatically
3. Session marked as "Completed"
4. Participant window closes

### Early Termination

To end a session early:

1. Press `Esc` or click **End Session**
2. Confirm in the dialog
3. Partial data saves with "Incomplete" status

<Warning>
Incomplete sessions have limited analysis options. Correspondence analysis requires all phases to complete.
</Warning>
