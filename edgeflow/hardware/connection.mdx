This guide covers connecting your Arduino dynamometer to EdgeFlow and configuring the serial communication.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting:

- Arduino is assembled with force sensor and firmware uploaded
- USB cable is available
- EdgeFlow is installed and running

---

## Connecting the Arduino

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect USB Cable">
    Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB. Use a direct connection—avoid USB hubs if possible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Recognition">
    Your computer should recognize the Arduino. On Windows, you may see a driver installation notification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note the Port">
    Identify the serial port:
    - **macOS**: `/dev/tty.usbmodem*` or `/dev/tty.usbserial*`
    - **Windows**: `COM3`, `COM4`, etc.
    - **Linux**: `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring in EdgeFlow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Hardware**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Serial Port">
    From the **Port** dropdown, select your Arduino's port.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Baud Rate">
    Ensure baud rate is set to **115200** (default for EdgeFlow firmware).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection**. You should see:
    - Connection status: "Connected"
    - Live force reading updating as you grip
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to store the configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connection Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Serial Port | Auto-detect | The COM port or device path |
| Baud Rate | 115200 | Communication speed |
| Auto-reconnect | Enabled | Automatically reconnect if disconnected |
| Timeout | 5 seconds | Connection timeout threshold |

<Note>
EdgeFlow remembers your port selection. If you always use the same USB port, the Arduino should auto-connect on future launches.
</Note>

---

## Port Selection

### macOS

Ports typically appear as:
- `/dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX` (genuine Arduino)
- `/dev/tty.usbserialXXXX` (FTDI-based boards)
- `/dev/tty.wchusbserialXXXX` (CH340 boards)

<Tip>
If multiple ports appear, disconnect the Arduino and note which port disappears. That's your Arduino.
</Tip>

### Windows

Ports appear as `COMx` where x is a number. To identify:

1. Open Device Manager
2. Expand **Ports (COM & LPT)**
3. Look for "Arduino" or "USB Serial Device"

### Linux

Ports typically appear as:
- `/dev/ttyACM0` (most Arduino boards)
- `/dev/ttyUSB0` (FTDI-based boards)

You may need to add your user to the `dialout` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

Log out and back in for the change to take effect.

## Connection Status

EdgeFlow shows connection status in multiple places:

| Location | Indicator |
| --- | --- |
| Home screen | System status panel |
| Settings > Hardware | Connection indicator |
| Session setup | Equipment checklist |
| Session runtime | Real-time status |

### Status States

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Connected | Arduino detected and responding |
| Disconnected | No connection established |
| Reconnecting | Connection lost, attempting to restore |
| Error | Connection failed with error |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port not appearing in dropdown">
    - Ensure USB cable is connected
    - Try a different USB cable (some cables are power-only)
    - Check if Arduino is powered (onboard LED should be on)
    - On Windows, install Arduino USB drivers
    - On Linux, check user permissions (dialout group)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection test fails">
    - Verify correct port is selected
    - Ensure baud rate matches firmware (115200)
    - Check that no other application is using the port (Arduino IDE, serial monitor)
    - Restart EdgeFlow and try again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection drops during session">
    - Use a direct USB connection (not through a hub)
    - Check for loose cable connections
    - Try a shorter USB cable
    - Ensure adequate power supply to the Arduino
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple ports showing">
    - Disconnect the Arduino
    - Refresh the port list
    - Reconnect and select the newly appeared port
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Baud Rate

If using custom firmware with different baud rate:

1. Open **Settings** > **Hardware** > **Advanced**
2. Enter custom baud rate
3. Test connection

<Warning>
Only change baud rate if you've modified the Arduino firmware. Mismatched baud rates will prevent communication.
</Warning>

### Connection Logging

For debugging connection issues:

1. Open **Settings** > **Advanced**
2. Enable **Debug logging**
3. Reproduce the issue
4. Check the log file at the displayed path
