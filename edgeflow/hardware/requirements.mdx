Conjugate reinforcement assessments require Arduino-based dynamometer hardware. This page covers the required components and specifications.

<Note>
Hardware is only required for Conjugate and Full Protocol assessments. VMSWO-only assessments work without any additional hardware.

## Recommended Setup

The simplest and most reliable setup uses an Arduino Nano mounted on a screw terminal breakout board. This eliminates soldering and provides secure, tool-free wire connections.

### Components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Arduino Nano | ATmega328P-based board with USB-C |
| Screw Terminal Breakout | Expansion shield that exposes all Nano pins via screw terminals |
| IPS121C Dynamometer | Vernier hand dynamometer with analog output |
| USB-C Cable | For connecting Nano to computer |

### Why Screw Terminals?

### Arduino Nano Specifications

| Specification | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Processor | ATmega328P |
| USB Interface | USB-C |
| Operating Voltage | 5V |
| Analog Inputs | A0-A7 |

<Tip>
Look for Arduino Nano kits that include both the Nano board and a matching screw terminal expansion shield. These are widely available and typically cost under $15 for both pieces.
</Tip>

### Force Sensor

| Specification | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Recommended | Vernier IPS121C Hand Dynamometer |
| Capacity | 0-60 kg range |
| Interface | Analog output (0-5V) |
| Connection | Direct to Arduino analog pin |

The IPS121C provides a linear 0-5V output mapping to 0-60 kg, making it ideal for conjugate reinforcement assessments.

<Note>
Other grip dynamometers with analog output may work but require firmware calibration adjustments.

## Wiring Overview

The EdgeFlow firmware is designed for the IPS121C Hand Dynamometer with direct analog connection:

```
IPS121C Dynamometer → Screw Terminal Breakout → Arduino Nano → USB → Computer
```

### Wiring with Screw Terminal Breakout

Using the screw terminal expansion board, connect the IPS121C dynamometer wires:

| IPS121C Wire | Screw Terminal | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Signal (voltage output) | A7 | Analog input for force readings |
| Power | 5V | Powers the dynamometer |
| Ground | GND | Common ground |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mount Nano on Breakout">
    Press the Arduino Nano into the screw terminal breakout board, aligning the pins.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Signal Wire">
    Insert the IPS121C signal wire into the A7 screw terminal and tighten.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Power">
    Insert the power wire into the 5V screw terminal and tighten.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Ground">
    Insert the ground wire into a GND screw terminal and tighten.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The firmware maps the 0-5V analog input to a 0-60 kg force range using linear conversion.

<Note>
The analog pin can be changed in the firmware by modifying `FORCE_SENSOR_PIN`. A7 is recommended for Arduino Nano.
</Note>

### Alternative: HX711 Load Cell Setup

If using a load cell with HX711 amplifier, custom firmware modifications are required:

| HX711 Pin | Arduino Pin |
| --- | --- |
| VCC | 5V |
| GND | GND |
| DT (Data) | Digital Pin 2 |
| SCK (Clock) | Digital Pin 3 |

<Warning>
The default EdgeFlow firmware expects direct analog input. Load cell setups with HX711 require firmware modifications.
</Warning>

## Arduino Firmware

EdgeFlow communicates with Arduino via serial protocol. The Arduino runs firmware that:

1. Reads force sensor at 20 Hz (every 50ms)
2. Outputs force values in `FORCE:XX.XXX` format via serial at 9600 baud
3. Performs automatic zero calibration on startup
4. Applies noise reduction filtering

### Firmware Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Auto Zero Calibration | Calibrates zero offset automatically at startup |
| Moving Average Filter | 10-sample filter for smooth, stable readings |
| ADC Oversampling | 4x oversampling for improved resolution |
| Deadband | 0.02 kg threshold eliminates noise near zero |
| Linear Mapping | 0-5V input maps to 0-60 kg output |

### Installing Firmware

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Firmware">
    Download the EdgeFlow Arduino firmware from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/bgfdev/edgeflow-arduino).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Arduino IDE">
    Launch Arduino IDE and open the downloaded `.ino` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Pin (if needed)">
    Verify the `FORCE_SENSOR_PIN` constant matches your wiring (A7 for Nano, A0 for Uno).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Board">
    Go to **Tools** > **Board** and select **Arduino Nano** or **Arduino Uno**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Port">
    Go to **Tools** > **Port** and select your Arduino's serial port.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload">
    Click **Upload** to flash the firmware.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Hardware

Before using in assessments, verify your hardware:

### Serial Monitor Test

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to **Tools** > **Serial Monitor**
3. Set baud rate to **9600**
4. You should see force readings in `FORCE:XX.XXX` format appearing every 50ms

### EdgeFlow Detection Test

1. Launch EdgeFlow
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Hardware**
3. Your Arduino should appear in the port list
4. Select the port and click **Test Connection**
5. Grip the dynamometer—force reading should update in real-time
