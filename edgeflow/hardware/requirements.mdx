Conjugate reinforcement assessments require Arduino-based dynamometer hardware. This page covers the required components and specifications.

<Note>
Hardware is only required for Conjugate and Full Protocol assessments. VMSWO-only assessments work without any additional hardware.

## Recommended Setup

### Arduino Board

| Specification | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Board Type | Arduino Uno R3 (recommended) or compatible |
| Processor | ATmega328P or equivalent |
| USB Interface | USB-B or USB-C |
| Operating Voltage | 5V |

<Tip>
Arduino Uno R3 is recommended for widest compatibility. Other boards may work but are not officially tested.
</Tip>

### Force Sensor

| Specification | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Strain gauge load cell or grip dynamometer |
| Capacity | 50kg minimum recommended |
| Interface | Analog output or HX711 amplifier |
| Sampling Rate | Support for 20Hz readings |

### Pre-Built Options

If you prefer not to build custom hardware:

- Commercial grip dynamometers with analog output
- Arduino-compatible force sensor kits with HX711 amplifier
- Research-grade hand dynamometers with serial output

<Note>
Contact your equipment supplier to confirm Arduino compatibility before purchasing.

## Wiring Overview

The default EdgeFlow firmware is designed for the IPS121C Hand Dynamometer with direct analog connection:

```
Dynamometer → Arduino A0 → USB → Computer
```

### Default Setup (IPS121C Dynamometer)

| Connection | Arduino Pin |
| --- | --- |
| Signal (voltage output) | A0 (Analog) |
| Power | 5V |
| Ground | GND |

The firmware maps the 0-5V analog input to a 0-60kg force range.

### Alternative: HX711 Load Cell Setup

If using a load cell with HX711 amplifier, custom firmware modifications are required:

| HX711 Pin | Arduino Pin |
| --- | --- |
| VCC | 5V |
| GND | GND |
| DT (Data) | Digital Pin 2 |
| SCK (Clock) | Digital Pin 3 |

<Warning>
The default EdgeFlow firmware expects direct analog input on A0. Load cell setups with HX711 require firmware modifications.
</Warning>

## Arduino Firmware

EdgeFlow communicates with Arduino via serial protocol. The Arduino must run compatible firmware that:

1. Reads force sensor at 20Hz
2. Outputs force values in kg via serial
3. Responds to calibration commands

### Installing Firmware

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Firmware">
    Download the EdgeFlow Arduino firmware from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/bgfdev/edgeflow-arduino).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Arduino IDE">
    Launch Arduino IDE and open the downloaded `.ino` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Board">
    Go to **Tools** > **Board** and select your Arduino model.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Port">
    Go to **Tools** > **Port** and select your Arduino's serial port.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload">
    Click **Upload** to flash the firmware.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Hardware

Before using in assessments, verify your hardware:

### Serial Monitor Test

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to **Tools** > **Serial Monitor**
3. Set baud rate to **9600**
4. You should see force readings in `FORCE:XX.XXX` format appearing every 50ms

### EdgeFlow Detection Test

1. Launch EdgeFlow
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Hardware**
3. Your Arduino should appear in the port list
4. Select the port and click **Test Connection**
5. Grip the dynamometer—force reading should update in real-time

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Arduino not detected">
    - Check USB cable connection
    - Try a different USB port
    - Install Arduino USB drivers if on Windows
    - Ensure no other application is using the serial port
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Force readings are zero">
    - Verify wiring connections
    - Check that firmware is uploaded correctly
    - Ensure HX711 power connections are correct
    - Try recalibrating (see [Calibration](/edgeflow/hardware/calibration))
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Readings are unstable or noisy">
    - Ensure solid mechanical connections
    - Check for loose wires
    - Use shielded cables if electrical noise is present
    - Verify adequate power supply
  </Accordion>
