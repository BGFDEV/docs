## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is EdgeFlow?">
    EdgeFlow is a desktop application for conducting behavioral preference assessments. It combines verbal multiple stimulus without replacement (VMSWO) procedures with conjugate reinforcement assessments to provide comprehensive preference data with correspondence analysis.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is EdgeFlow for?">
    EdgeFlow is designed for:
    - Behavioral researchers conducting preference assessment studies
    - ABA practitioners evaluating stimulus preferences
    - Clinical settings requiring structured preference evaluations
    - Academic environments teaching preference assessment methodology
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What platforms does EdgeFlow support?">
    EdgeFlow runs on:
    - macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
    - Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
    - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ or equivalent)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes. EdgeFlow stores all data locally on your computer using SQLCipher encryption (AES-256). Data is never transmitted to external servers. Your database password protects access to all participant information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need special hardware?">
    - **For VMSWO-only assessments**: No special hardware required
    - **For conjugate assessments**: Arduino with dynamometer sensor required

    See [Hardware Requirements](/edgeflow/hardware/requirements) for details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Assessments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between VMSWO, Conjugate, and Full Protocol?">
    - **VMSWO Only**: Measures verbal/stated preferences through structured selection across 3 blocks
    - **Conjugate Only**: Measures behavioral engagement through grip force during stimulus exposure
    - **Full Protocol**: Runs both sequentially, enabling correspondence analysis between verbal and behavioral measures

    See [Assessment Types](/edgeflow/concepts/assessments) for full details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are stimulus sets limited to 5 items?">
    The VMSWO methodology requires exactly 5 stimuli for proper counterbalancing across 3 blocks. This ensures:
    - Each stimulus can occupy each position
    - Statistical validity of preference rankings
    - Consistent assessment duration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use both images and audio in one session?">
    No. Each session uses one stimulus type (all images or all audio). This maintains consistency in the assessment procedure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does a typical session take?">
    - VMSWO Only: 5-10 minutes
    - Conjugate Only: 5-10 minutes
    - Full Protocol: 15-20 minutes

    Actual duration depends on your configured settings (trial length, ITI, etc.).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I pause a session and resume later?">
    No. Once started, sessions run continuously until completion. If interrupted, partial data is saved but the session is marked incomplete.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Hardware

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What Arduino board should I use?">
    Arduino Uno R3 is recommended for widest compatibility. Arduino Nano and other compatible boards may work but are not officially tested.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I get the dynamometer hardware?">
    Options include:
    - Build your own using load cell and HX711 amplifier
    - Commercial grip dynamometers with analog output
    - Arduino-compatible force sensor kits

    See [Hardware Requirements](/edgeflow/hardware/requirements) for specifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should I calibrate?">
    Calibrate:
    - Before first use with new hardware
    - Monthly during active use
    - After any component replacement
    - If readings seem inaccurate
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use EdgeFlow without hardware?">
    Yes. VMSWO-only assessments require no additional hardware. Only conjugate and Full Protocol assessments need the Arduino dynamometer.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where is my data stored?">
    All data is stored locally in an encrypted database:
    - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/EdgeFlow/`
    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\EdgeFlow\`
    - Linux: `~/.config/EdgeFlow/`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is any data sent to the cloud?">
    No. EdgeFlow operates entirely offline. No data is transmitted to external servers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I back up my data?">
    EdgeFlow can automatically back up your database:
    1. Go to Settings > Data Management
    2. Configure backup frequency and location
    3. Backups are encrypted with the same password as your database
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export data for use in other software?">
    Yes. Export to:
    - CSV: For Excel, SPSS, R, and other statistical software
    - JSON: For programmatic access and custom analysis

    See [Data Export](/edgeflow/guide/export) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I forget my password?">
    If you forget your database password and haven't saved it to the system keychain, the encrypted data cannot be recovered. Store your password securely and enable keychain storage if available.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Analysis

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is correspondence analysis?">
    Correspondence analysis compares VMSWO preference rankings with conjugate force data to determine whether stated preferences match behavioral engagement. It's only available for completed Full Protocol sessions.

    See [Correspondence Analysis](/edgeflow/concepts/correspondence) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do the correspondence classifications mean?">
    | Classification | Meaning |
    | --- | --- |
    | HP/LP | High force for high-preference, low force for low-preference (ideal) |
    | HP-Only | High force for HP only |
    | LP-Only | Low force for LP only |
    | Decreasing | Force decreases across trials regardless of preference |
    | Undifferentiated | No clear pattern |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is preference ranking calculated?">
    Stimuli are scored based on selection order in each VMSWO block (5 points for 1st selection, 1 point for last). Scores are summed across blocks and stimuli are ranked by total score.

    See [Preference Ranking](/edgeflow/concepts/preference-ranking) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What statistical tests are available?">
    EdgeFlow includes a chi-square calculator for testing correspondence significance. You can export data to use other statistical tests in your preferred software.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
