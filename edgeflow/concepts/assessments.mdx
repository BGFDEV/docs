EdgeFlow supports three assessment types, each designed for specific research objectives. Understanding these methodologies is essential for conducting valid preference evaluations.

## VMSWO (Verbal Multiple Stimulus Without Replacement)

VMSWO is a preference assessment procedure where participants verbally indicate their most preferred stimulus from an array, with selected items removed from subsequent presentations.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Presentation">
    All 5 stimuli are presented simultaneously. The participant is asked: "Which one do you want most?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Selection and Removal">
    When the participant selects a stimulus, it is removed from the array. This selection is recorded.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeated Presentations">
    The remaining stimuli are presented again. The participant selects from 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 stimulus.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Block Completion">
    When all 5 stimuli have been selected, the block is complete and a preference order is established.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Counterbalancing Across Blocks

EdgeFlow uses **circular rotation** to control for order effects. Each of the 3 blocks presents stimuli in a different initial order:

| Block | Initial Order |
| --- | --- |
| Block 1 | A, B, C, D, E |
| Block 2 | B, C, D, E, A |
| Block 3 | C, D, E, A, B |

This ensures that position bias (e.g., always selecting the first item) is distributed across stimuli.

### Output

VMSWO produces a **preference ranking** from 1 (most preferred) to 5 (least preferred) based on aggregate selection frequency across all blocks.

## Conjugate Reinforcement Assessment

Conjugate reinforcement assessment measures behavioral engagement with stimuli through force-based feedback. Participants grip a dynamometer while viewing stimuli, and their grip force indicates engagement level.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stimulus Presentation">
    A stimulus is displayed on screen at full clarity (100% opacity).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Force Measurement">
    The participant grips the dynamometer. Force readings are captured continuously at 20Hz.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clarity Feedback">
    The stimulus clarity fades over time. Applying grip force restores clarity, creating a contingency between effort and stimulus access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trial Completion">
    After the trial duration elapses, the stimulus is removed and an inter-trial interval begins before the next stimulus.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Clarity Mechanic

The "clarity" system creates a conjugate reinforcement schedule:

- **Clarity starts at 100%** (fully visible/audible)
- **Clarity fades at a configurable rate** (default: 10% per second)
- **Applying force restores clarity** proportionally (default: 10 clarity units per 1 kg of force)
- **Minimum clarity is 10%** (stimulus never completely disappears)

This mechanic means participants must actively engage (grip harder) to maintain access to preferred stimuli.

### Force Metrics

EdgeFlow captures and calculates:

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Peak Force | Maximum grip force during the trial (kg) |
| Mean Force | Average grip force across the trial (kg) |
| Force Samples | Raw readings at 20Hz for detailed analysis |

### Output

Conjugate assessment produces **force rankings** based on mean or peak force per stimulus, allowing comparison with VMSWO preference rankings.

## Full Protocol

The Full Protocol runs both assessments sequentially:

<Steps>
  <Step title="VMSWO Phase">
    Complete VMSWO assessment across 3 blocks to establish preference rankings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Transition">
    EdgeFlow transitions to conjugate phase without researcher intervention.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conjugate Phase">
    Run conjugate reinforcement trials with the same stimuli to measure behavioral engagement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Correspondence Analysis">
    Compare VMSWO rankings with force rankings to evaluate preference-behavior correspondence.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The Full Protocol is the recommended assessment type when you need to evaluate whether stated preferences correspond with behavioral engagement.
</Tip>

## Choosing an Assessment Type

| Assessment | Use When |
| --- | --- |
| **VMSWO Only** | You only need verbal preference data, no hardware available, or for initial screening |
| **Conjugate Only** | You have established preferences and want to measure engagement, or for follow-up studies |
| **Full Protocol** | You need complete preference-behavior correspondence data for research or clinical decisions |

<Note>
Conjugate assessments require Arduino dynamometer hardware. See [Hardware Requirements](/edgeflow/hardware/requirements) for setup instructions.
