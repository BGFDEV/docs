Preference ranking is the primary output of VMSWO assessments. This guide explains how rankings are calculated and how to interpret them.

## How Rankings Are Calculated

EdgeFlow calculates preference rankings by aggregating selection data across all 3 blocks of a VMSWO assessment.

### Selection Position

Each stimulus is tracked by when it was selected in each block:

| Selection Order | Position Value |
| --- | --- |
| 1st selected (from 5 stimuli) | 1 |
| 2nd selected (from 4 stimuli) | 2 |
| 3rd selected (from 3 stimuli) | 3 |
| 4th selected (from 2 stimuli) | 4 |
| 5th selected (last remaining) | 5 |

### Preference Percentage Calculation

EdgeFlow calculates a **preference percentage** for each stimulus using the average selection position across all blocks:

```
Preference % = ((6 - Average Selection Position) / 5) × 100
```

| Average Position | Preference % | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 (always 1st) | 100% | Highest preference |
| 2.0 (always 2nd) | 80% | High preference |
| 3.0 (always 3rd) | 60% | Moderate preference |
| 4.0 (always 4th) | 40% | Low preference |
| 5.0 (always 5th) | 20% | Lowest preference |

Stimuli are ranked by preference percentage, with the highest percentage receiving Rank 1.

### Handling Ties

When stimuli have equal preference percentages:

1. EdgeFlow uses first-selection frequency as a tiebreaker
2. If still tied, the order from the most recent block determines rank
3. Ties are noted in the session results

## Understanding the Ranking

### High-Preference vs Low-Preference

Stimuli are typically classified based on their rank:

| Rank | Classification | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 | High-Preference (HP) | Consistently selected early; likely reinforcing |
| 3 | Moderate | Variable selection; unclear preference |
| 4-5 | Low-Preference (LP) | Consistently selected late; likely less reinforcing |

<Tip>
The HP/LP classification is used in correspondence analysis to evaluate whether behavioral engagement matches stated preferences.
</Tip>

### Block-Level Analysis

EdgeFlow also shows individual block rankings:

| Block | Stimulus A | Stimulus B | Stimulus C | Stimulus D | Stimulus E |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Block 1 | 1st | 3rd | 2nd | 5th | 4th |
| Block 2 | 2nd | 1st | 3rd | 4th | 5th |
| Block 3 | 1st | 2nd | 4th | 5th | 3rd |
| **Overall** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **5** | **4** |

This breakdown helps identify:
- **Consistent preferences**: Same stimulus ranked highly across all blocks
- **Variable preferences**: Rank changes significantly between blocks
- **Position effects**: A stimulus always selected first regardless of array position (may indicate bias)

## Counterbalancing and Order Effects

### Why Counterbalancing Matters

Without counterbalancing, position bias can contaminate results. A participant who always selects the leftmost stimulus would artificially inflate the preference score of whichever stimulus appears first.

### How EdgeFlow Counterbalances

EdgeFlow uses **circular rotation** across blocks:

```
Block 1: [A, B, C, D, E]
Block 2: [B, C, D, E, A]
Block 3: [C, D, E, A, B]
```

Each stimulus occupies:
- The first position in one block
- The last position in one block
- Middle positions in one block

### Detecting Position Bias

If a participant consistently selects the first stimulus regardless of content:

- All stimuli would receive similar preference percentages due to counterbalancing
- No clear preference pattern would emerge
- EdgeFlow highlights this pattern in results

## Interpreting Results

### Strong Preference Patterns

<Check>
A strong preference pattern shows one or two stimuli consistently ranked 1st or 2nd across all blocks, with clear separation from lower-ranked stimuli.
</Check>

Example:
- Stimulus A: Rank 1 (100% preference, always selected 1st)
- Stimulus B: Rank 2 (80% preference, average position 2.0)
- Stimulus C: Rank 3 (53% preference, average position 3.3)
- Stimulus D: Rank 4 (40% preference, average position 4.0)
- Stimulus E: Rank 5 (27% preference, average position 4.7)

### Weak or Unclear Patterns

<Warning>
When preference percentages cluster together (e.g., all between 50-60%), preferences may not be well-differentiated. Consider:
- Using different stimuli
- Re-running the assessment on a different day
- Evaluating if the participant understands the task
</Warning>

### No Preference

If all stimuli receive similar preference percentages across blocks, the participant may:
- Have no strong preference among the options
- Not understand the task
- Be selecting randomly

## Using Rankings

Preference rankings inform:

| Use Case | Application |
| --- | --- |
| Intervention planning | Use HP stimuli as reinforcers, avoid LP stimuli |
| Research analysis | Compare rankings across participants or conditions |
| Correspondence evaluation | Compare to conjugate force data to validate preferences |
| Stimulus selection | Remove LP stimuli, replace with alternatives |

<Note>
VMSWO rankings reflect verbal/stated preferences. Correspondence analysis with conjugate data reveals whether these preferences match behavioral engagement.
