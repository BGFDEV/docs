Assessment settings control how EdgeFlow conducts VMSWO and conjugate assessments. Configure these to match your research protocol.

## Accessing Settings

Navigate to **Settings** > **Assessment** to view and modify these options.

## VMSWO Settings

### Block Configuration

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Number of Blocks | 3 | 1-5 | How many VMSWO blocks per session |
| Counterbalancing | Circular rotation | Fixed, Random, Circular | How stimulus order varies across blocks |

<Note>
The standard VMSWO methodology uses 3 blocks with circular rotation. Only change these if your protocol specifically requires different parameters.
</Note>

### Timing

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instruction Duration | 5 seconds | How long instructions display before starting |
| Block Transition Duration | 3 seconds | Pause between blocks |

---

## Conjugate Settings

### Trial Parameters

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Max Trial Duration | None (unlimited) | 10-120 sec or None | Maximum length per stimulus trial |

<Note>
By default, trials have no time limit and end when clarity drops to 10%. Set a max duration if you need fixed-length trials.
</Note>

### Clarity Mechanic

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Clarity Duration | 1 second | 0-5 sec | Time stimulus stays at 100% before fading |
| Fade Rate | 10%/sec | 1-50%/sec | How quickly clarity decreases |
| Force-to-Clarity Ratio | 10:1 | 1-100:1 | Clarity units restored per kg of force |
| Trial End Threshold | 10% | N/A | Trial ends when clarity drops to this level |

<Tip>
Lower fade rates and higher force ratios make the task easier. Adjust based on participant capabilities and your research goals.
</Tip>

### Inter-Trial Interval (ITI)

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ITI Duration | 3 seconds | 2-10 sec | Rest period between trials |
| Show Countdown | On | On/Off | Display countdown timer during ITI |
| Allow Manual Skip | Off | On/Off | Let researcher skip remaining ITI |

---

## Presentation Order

Control the order stimuli are presented during conjugate phase:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Quasi-Random (default) | Randomized with constraints (no consecutive repeats) |
| VMSWO-Ranked | Present in order of VMSWO preference (HP first) |
| Counterbalanced | Systematic Latin square rotation across participants |
| Fully Random | Completely randomized order (not recommended) |

<Tip>
**Quasi-random** is the default and recommended for most research protocols. It provides experimental control while avoiding order effects.
</Tip>

## Researcher Information

Stored with each session for documentation:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Researcher Name | Name of person conducting sessions |
| Institution | Organization or facility name |
| Contact Email | Contact for data inquiries |
| IRB Protocol Number | Ethics approval reference |

---

## Per-Session Overrides

Most settings can be overridden when creating a session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Session Setup">
    Begin the session creation wizard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Advanced Options">
    Click **Advanced Options** before launching.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify Settings">
    Change any parameters for this session only.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    The session uses your overrides; defaults remain unchanged.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resetting to Defaults

To restore all assessment settings to defaults:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Assessment**
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click **Reset to Defaults**
4. Confirm the reset

<Warning>
This resets all assessment settings. Per-session overrides on existing sessions are not affected.
</Warning>
