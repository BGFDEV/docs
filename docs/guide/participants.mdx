EdgeFlow stores participant information securely in an encrypted database. This guide covers participant management workflows.

## Participant Records

Each participant record includes:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identifier | Yes | Unique ID for the participant (e.g., "P001", "Participant A") |
| Notes | No | Free-text field for additional information |
| Created Date | Auto | Timestamp when record was created |
| Session Count | Auto | Number of completed sessions |

<Note>
Use anonymized identifiers rather than real names to protect participant privacy. Store identifying information separately according to your IRB protocol.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent identifier formats">
    Establish a naming convention before data collection (e.g., "P001", "P002" or "Cohort1-01", "Cohort1-02"). This makes sorting and filtering easier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add notes during or after sessions">
    Use the notes field to record relevant observations: environmental factors, participant state, procedural deviations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review before deleting">
    Always export participant data before deletion if there's any chance you may need it later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular backups">
    Configure automatic backups in Settings to protect participant data. See [Data Management](/edgeflow/settings/data).
  </Accordion>
