Sessions are the core unit of data collection in EdgeFlow. Each session represents one complete assessment for one participant.

## Session Setup Wizard

EdgeFlow uses a step-by-step wizard to configure sessions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start New Session">
    From the home screen, click **New Session**. Or navigate to a participant and click **Start Session**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Participant">
    Choose the participant from the dropdown. You can also create a new participant from this screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Assessment Type">
    Select one of:
    - **VMSWO Only**: Verbal preference assessment only
    - **Conjugate Only**: Force-based assessment only (requires hardware)
    - **Full Protocol**: VMSWO followed by Conjugate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Stimulus Type">
    Choose **Image** or **Audio** depending on your prepared stimuli.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Stimulus Set">
    Select from available stimulus sets of the chosen type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Equipment Checklist">
    Verify equipment readiness (see below).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Session">
    Click **Start Session** to begin.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assessment Type Selection

Choose based on your research objectives:

| Type | Duration | Hardware | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VMSWO Only | ~5-10 min | None | Preference rankings |
| Conjugate Only | ~5-10 min | Arduino required | Force data |
| Full Protocol | ~15-20 min | Arduino required | Rankings + Force + Correspondence |

<Tip>
If you're unsure which assessment type to use, see [Assessment Types](/edgeflow/concepts/assessments) for detailed guidance.

## Equipment Checklist

Before starting a session, EdgeFlow displays a checklist:

### VMSWO-Only Checklist

- [ ] Participant window display ready
- [ ] Researcher can see participant responses
- [ ] Stimulus set loaded correctly (preview available)

### Conjugate / Full Protocol Checklist

- [ ] Arduino connected and detected
- [ ] Dynamometer calibrated recently
- [ ] Force readings responding correctly
- [ ] Participant window display ready
- [ ] Stimulus set loaded correctly

<Warning>
Do not proceed if any checklist items are incomplete. Unready hardware can result in lost data.
</Warning>

### Verifying Hardware Readiness

The checklist shows real-time status:

| Indicator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Green checkmark | Ready |
| Yellow warning | Needs attention |
| Red X | Not ready—cannot proceed |

Click any item to see details or navigate to fix the issue.

## Pre-Session Configuration

Before launching, you can adjust session-specific settings:

### Quick Settings

| Setting | Description | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trial Duration | Maximum length per conjugate trial | Advanced settings panel |
| ITI Duration | Time between trials | Advanced settings panel |
| Presentation Order | Stimulus order strategy | Advanced settings panel |

### Default vs. Session Settings

Settings configured here override your default settings for this session only. To change defaults, go to **Settings** > **Assessment**.

<Note>
Most users can proceed with default settings. Only adjust if your research protocol requires specific parameters.
</Note>

## Launching the Session

When you click **Start Session**:

1. EdgeFlow opens the **Participant Window** (separate window/display)
2. The main window becomes the **Researcher Monitor**
3. Data recording begins

<Warning>
Once a session is launched, it cannot be paused. Ensure the participant and environment are ready before starting.
</Warning>

### Multi-Display Setup

For optimal use:

1. Connect a second monitor
2. Drag the participant window to the participant-facing display
3. Keep the researcher monitor on your primary display

EdgeFlow remembers window positions for future sessions.

## Session States

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Not Started | Session configured but not launched |
| In Progress | Currently running |
| Completed | All phases finished, data saved |
| Incomplete | Session terminated before completion |

<Note>
Incomplete sessions are saved with partial data. You can view what was collected, but correspondence analysis requires completed Full Protocol sessions.
</Note>

---

## Canceling a Session

If you need to stop a session before completion:

1. Press `Esc` or click **End Session** in the researcher monitor
2. Confirm cancellation in the dialog
3. Partial data is saved with "Incomplete" status

<Warning>
Canceled sessions cannot be resumed. You must start a new session to re-collect data.
</Warning>
