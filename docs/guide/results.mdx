## Session Overview

The results page header shows:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Participant | Who completed the session |
| Date/Time | When the session occurred |
| Assessment Type | VMSWO, Conjugate, or Full Protocol |
| Status | Completed or Incomplete |
| Duration | Total session time |

---

## VMSWO Results

### Rankings Table

The primary output showing preference hierarchy:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Rank | Final preference rank (1 = most preferred) |
| Stimulus | Stimulus name/thumbnail |
| Total Score | Aggregate selection score |
| Block 1/2/3 | Rank within each block |
| Selection Count | Times selected first |

### Interpreting Rankings

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="High-Preference (HP)" icon="arrow-up">
    Ranks 1-2: Consistently selected early across blocks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low-Preference (LP)" icon="arrow-down">
    Ranks 4-5: Consistently selected late across blocks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Block-Level Detail

Click **Show Block Details** to expand:

- Individual selection order for each block
- Visual representation of selection patterns
- Detection of position bias or inconsistency

## Conjugate Results

### Force Metrics Table

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Stimulus | Stimulus name/thumbnail |
| Mean Force | Average grip force across trial (kg) |
| Peak Force | Maximum grip force recorded (kg) |
| Force Rank | Rank by mean force (1 = highest) |
| Trial Duration | Actual trial length |

### Force-Time Visualization

Each stimulus shows a force graph:

- X-axis: Time (seconds)
- Y-axis: Force (kg)
- Interactive: Hover for exact values
- Overlay: Clarity level throughout trial

### Aggregate Patterns

The aggregate view shows:

- Force distribution by stimulus (box plots)
- Comparison across stimuli
- Force trends across trials

---

## Correspondence Analysis

<Note>
Correspondence analysis is only available for completed Full Protocol sessions.
</Note>

### Correspondence Classification

EdgeFlow automatically classifies the session:

| Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| HP/LP Correspondence | High force for HP stimuli, low force for LP stimuli |
| HP-Only | High force for HP only, LP force undifferentiated |
| LP-Only | Low force for LP only, HP force undifferentiated |
| Decreasing Trend | Force decreases across presentations |
| Undifferentiated | No clear pattern between preference and force |

### Visualization

The correspondence panel includes:

- **Rank Comparison**: VMSWO rank vs Force rank for each stimulus
- **Heatmap**: Visual matrix of force by stimulus and trial
- **Scatter Plot**: Preference rank vs mean force

### Statistical Output

Click **Chi-Square Analysis** for formal statistics:

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Chi-square statistic | Measure of correspondence strength |
| Degrees of freedom | Based on stimulus count |
| p-value | Statistical significance |
| Interpretation | Plain-language explanation |

---

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review results immediately after session">
    Check for data quality issues while the session is fresh. Note any anomalies in force readings or unexpected ranking patterns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compare with previous sessions">
    For repeated assessments, compare rankings and force patterns across sessions to evaluate preference stability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document correspondence classification">
    Record the correspondence result and your interpretation. This informs reinforcer selection decisions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Export before deleting">
    Always export session data before any deletions. See [Data Export](/edgeflow/guide/export).
  </Accordion>
