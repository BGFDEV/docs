Proper calibration ensures accurate and consistent force measurements across sessions. EdgeFlow uses a two-point calibration process.

## When to Calibrate

Calibrate your dynamometer:

- **Before first use** with new hardware
- **After replacing** the load cell or sensor
- **If readings drift** or seem inaccurate
- **Periodically** (recommended: monthly during active use)
- **After significant temperature changes** in the environment

---

## Calibration Process

EdgeFlow uses two-point calibration:

1. **Zero offset**: Reading with no force applied
2. **Known weight**: Reading with a known weight applied

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Calibration">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Hardware** > **Calibration**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure Connection">
    Verify Arduino is connected (green status indicator).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Calibration">
    Click **Start Calibration** to begin the wizard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Zero Calibration">
    Ensure nothing is touching or pressing the sensor. Click **Capture Zero** when stable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Known Weight Calibration">
    Apply a known weight (e.g., 5 kg). Enter the weight value and click **Capture Weight** when stable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Test by applying different known weights and checking accuracy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save Calibration** to store the values.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Detailed Instructions

### Step 1: Zero Offset

<Note>
The zero offset captures the sensor reading when no force is applied. This accounts for sensor drift and environmental factors.
</Note>

1. Orient the dynamometer in its normal use position
2. Ensure nothing is touching the grip or sensor
3. Wait for readings to stabilize (2-3 seconds)
4. Click **Capture Zero**

EdgeFlow captures multiple readings and averages them.

### Step 2: Known Weight

<Note>
The known weight provides a reference point for scaling raw sensor values to kilograms.
</Note>

1. You'll need a known weight between 2-10 kg
2. Apply the weight directly to the sensor in the same orientation used during assessment
3. Hold steadily until readings stabilize
4. Enter the exact weight value in the input field
5. Click **Capture Weight**

<Tip>
Use a calibrated weight (like gym weights) for best accuracy. If using household items, weigh them on a reliable scale first.
</Tip>

## Verification

After calibration, verify accuracy:

### Quick Check

1. Apply no force—reading should be 0.0 kg (±0.1 kg)
2. Apply your known weight—reading should match (±0.2 kg)
3. Apply approximately half the known weight—reading should be roughly half

### Detailed Verification

1. Test multiple known weights if available
2. Check readings at different grip positions
3. Verify consistency over several minutes

If readings are consistently off by more than 5%, recalibrate.

## Calibration Data

EdgeFlow stores calibration with:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Zero Offset | Raw sensor value at zero force |
| Scale Factor | Conversion factor to kg |
| Calibration Date | When calibration was performed |
| Known Weight | Weight used during calibration |

### Viewing Calibration History

Navigate to **Settings** > **Hardware** > **Calibration History** to see:

- Past calibration records with timestamps
- Drift trends over time
- Option to restore previous calibration

## Calibration Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent orientation">
    Calibrate with the sensor in the same position it will be used during assessments. Gravity affects readings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Allow warm-up time">
    If the equipment has been in storage, allow 5-10 minutes at room temperature before calibrating.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use appropriate weight">
    Choose a calibration weight in the typical measurement range. If participants usually grip at 2-5 kg, calibrate with 5 kg rather than 20 kg.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document your process">
    Note the weight used and any observations. This helps if you need to recalibrate or troubleshoot later.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Zero reading is not zero after calibration">
    - Ensure nothing was touching the sensor during zero capture
    - Check for mechanical binding or friction in the grip
    - Try recalibrating in a stable environment
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Readings are unstable during calibration">
    - Allow more time for readings to stabilize
    - Hold weights steadily—any movement affects readings
    - Check for loose wiring or connections
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Readings are off after calibration">
    - Verify the known weight is accurate
    - Ensure weight was applied in the correct direction
    - Check that orientation matches assessment use
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Calibration doesn't persist">
    - Ensure you clicked **Save Calibration**
    - Check for sufficient disk space
    - Verify you have write permissions to EdgeFlow data directory
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Resetting Calibration

To reset to factory defaults:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Hardware** > **Calibration**
2. Click **Reset to Defaults**
3. Confirm the reset
4. Perform a fresh calibration

<Warning>
Resetting calibration removes all stored calibration data. You must recalibrate before using the dynamometer in assessments.
</Warning>
