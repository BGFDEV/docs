Stimuli are the core materials used in EdgeFlow assessments. This guide covers how to organize and manage your stimulus library.

## Stimulus Types

EdgeFlow supports two stimulus types:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Image Stimuli" icon="image">
    JPG, PNG, GIF, or WebP image files displayed during assessment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audio Stimuli" icon="volume-high">
    MP3, WAV, or M4A audio files played during assessment.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
A session can only use one stimulus type. You cannot mix images and audio in the same assessment.
</Warning>

## Stimulus Library

The stimulus library is your central repository for all stimulus files.

### Adding Stimuli

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Library">
    Go to **Settings**, then select **Stimuli** from the settings navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Stimuli">
    Click the **Add Stimuli** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Files">
    Choose one or more files from your computer. For bulk upload, select multiple files at once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Upload">
    Files are processed and added to your library with auto-generated thumbnails for images.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### File Requirements

**Images:**
| Requirement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Formats | PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP |
| Max Size | 5 MB per file |
| Min Dimensions | 800 × 600 pixels |
| Recommended Aspect Ratio | 4:3 |

**Audio:**
| Requirement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Formats | MP3 |
| Max Size | 10 MB per file |
| Duration | 3-60 seconds |

<Tip>
Use consistent image dimensions across your stimulus set for uniform presentation. 4:3 aspect ratio images display best in the assessment window.
</Tip>

### Audio Clarity in Conjugate Assessments

During conjugate trials with audio stimuli, EdgeFlow uses a **low-pass filter** instead of visual opacity to create the clarity effect:

- At 100% clarity: Full audio frequency (up to 20,000 Hz)
- At 0% clarity: Audio filtered to 100 Hz (muffled/bass only)
- The frequency cutoff scales exponentially for perceptual linearity

This creates an audible degradation effect similar to visual fading for images.

### Managing Stimuli

From the library, you can:

- **Preview** stimuli by clicking the thumbnail
- **Rename** stimuli for easier identification
- **Delete** unused stimuli (only if not used in any stimulus set)
- **View usage** to see which sets include each stimulus

## Stimulus Sets

A stimulus set is a group of exactly 5 stimuli used together in an assessment.

### Why 5 Stimuli?

The VMSWO methodology requires exactly 5 stimuli per set to enable proper counterbalancing across 3 blocks. This fixed number ensures:

- Each stimulus can occupy each position
- Statistical validity of preference rankings
- Consistent assessment duration

### Creating a Set

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Stimulus Library">
    Navigate to **Settings**, then select **Stimuli** from the settings navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Set">
    Click the **Create Set** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Set">
    Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Food Items Set A", "Music Clips Week 1").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 5 Stimuli">
    Click to select exactly 5 stimuli from your library. Selected items show a checkmark.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save Set** to create the stimulus set.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
All 5 stimuli in a set must be the same type (all images or all audio).
</Note>

### Managing Sets

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| View | See which stimuli are included in a set |
| Edit | Change the name or swap stimuli (if no sessions use this set) |
| Duplicate | Create a copy of the set to modify |
| Delete | Remove the set (only if no sessions reference it) |

### Set Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names for your stimulus sets:

- Include the category: "Toys Set 1", "Foods Set A"
- Include date/version if relevant: "Music 2024-03", "Images v2"
- Avoid generic names: "Test", "Set 1", "Untitled"

## Using Sets in Sessions

When creating a session, you select a stimulus set:

1. Choose the participant
2. Select the assessment type
3. Choose stimulus type (Image or Audio)
4. Select from available sets of that type

The same set can be used across multiple sessions and participants.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prepare stimuli before sessions">
    Upload and organize all stimuli into sets before scheduling assessment sessions. This avoids delays during participant visits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent naming">
    Establish a naming convention for your research project. Consistent names make data analysis easier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Back up original files">
    Keep copies of your original stimulus files outside EdgeFlow. The database stores processed copies, not originals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test sets before live sessions">
    Create a test participant and run a practice session with new stimulus sets to verify all files display correctly.
