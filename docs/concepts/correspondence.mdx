Correspondence analysis compares VMSWO preference rankings with conjugate reinforcement force data to determine whether stated preferences match behavioral engagement.

## What is Correspondence?

Correspondence refers to the alignment between:

- **Verbal preferences**: What the participant says they prefer (VMSWO ranking)
- **Behavioral engagement**: How much effort they expend to access stimuli (conjugate force)

When a participant applies more force to access stimuli they ranked as high-preference, there is **correspondence** between their verbal and behavioral responses.

## Correspondence Classifications

EdgeFlow automatically classifies each session into one of five patterns:

### HP/LP Correspondence

<Check>
High force for high-preference stimuli AND low force for low-preference stimuli.
</Check>

This is the ideal outcome indicating:
- VMSWO rankings are valid indicators of preference
- The participant's verbal responses match their behavioral engagement
- Selected HP stimuli are likely to function as effective reinforcers

### HP-Only Correspondence

High force for high-preference stimuli, but force for low-preference stimuli is **not** differentiated.

This indicates:
- HP stimuli are behaviorally preferred
- LP stimuli may still evoke moderate engagement
- Consider evaluating additional stimuli to find true LP items

### LP-Only Correspondence

Low force for low-preference stimuli, but force for high-preference stimuli is **not** differentiated.

This indicates:
- LP identification is accurate
- HP stimuli may not be strongly preferred
- May need to identify more potent HP stimuli

### Decreasing Trend

Force decreases across presentations regardless of preference ranking.

This may indicate:
- Fatigue or satiation
- Loss of motivation during the assessment
- Need for shorter trial durations or breaks

### Undifferentiated

No clear pattern between preference ranking and force.

This indicates:
- VMSWO rankings do not predict behavioral engagement
- Verbal and behavioral preference measures do not align
- May reflect participant characteristics, stimulus selection, or procedural issues

## How Correspondence is Calculated

### Force Ranking

EdgeFlow ranks stimuli by mean force (or peak force, depending on settings):

1. Calculate mean force for each stimulus across all conjugate trials
2. Rank stimuli from highest force (1) to lowest force (5)

### Comparing Rankings

The VMSWO preference rank is compared to the force rank:

| Stimulus | VMSWO Rank | Force Rank | Match? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 1 | 2 | Close |
| B | 2 | 1 | Close |
| C | 3 | 3 | Match |
| D | 4 | 5 | Close |
| E | 5 | 4 | Close |

### Classification Logic

EdgeFlow evaluates:

1. **HP Analysis**: Do stimuli ranked 1-2 in VMSWO receive the highest force?
2. **LP Analysis**: Do stimuli ranked 4-5 in VMSWO receive the lowest force?
3. **Trend Analysis**: Does force systematically decrease across trials?
4. **Differentiation**: Is there meaningful variance in force across stimuli?

## Statistical Analysis

### Chi-Square Test

EdgeFlow includes a chi-square calculator for formal correspondence testing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Analysis">
    Navigate to the **Analysis** page or open a completed session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Chi-Square Calculator">
    Click the **Chi-Square** button or tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    EdgeFlow displays the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The chi-square test evaluates whether the observed correspondence pattern differs significantly from chance.

### Interpreting Statistical Output

| Statistic | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| Chi-square | Higher values indicate stronger deviation from expected |
| p-value < 0.05 | Statistically significant correspondence |
| p-value ≥ 0.05 | Correspondence may be due to chance |

<Note>
Statistical significance does not imply clinical significance. Use chi-square results alongside visual inspection of force patterns.
</Note>

## Visualizing Correspondence

EdgeFlow provides several visualizations:

### Force-Rank Heatmap

A matrix showing force values by stimulus and trial, with color intensity indicating force magnitude. Use this to spot patterns at a glance.

### Force Distribution Chart

Bar or box plots comparing force distributions for HP vs LP stimuli. Clear separation indicates correspondence.

### Time-Series Plots

Force over time for each trial, showing engagement patterns within and across stimuli.

## Using Correspondence Results

| Result | Implication | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HP/LP Correspondence | VMSWO is a valid preference indicator | Use VMSWO rankings for intervention |
| HP-Only | HP stimuli are valid | Seek better LP discriminators |
| LP-Only | LP identification is valid | Seek more potent HP stimuli |
| Decreasing Trend | Assessment procedure issue | Shorten trials, add breaks |
| Undifferentiated | VMSWO may not predict behavior | Use alternative assessment or different stimuli |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Run Full Protocol for clinical decisions">
    When selecting reinforcers for intervention, run the Full Protocol to verify correspondence before committing to stimuli.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider individual patterns">
    Some participants may show verbal-behavioral discordance due to language, motor, or motivational factors. Use multiple data sources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Replicate before concluding">
    A single session may not represent stable preferences. Consider running multiple sessions to confirm patterns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document undifferentiated results">
    Undifferentiated correspondence is a valid finding. Document it rather than discarding—it may inform stimulus selection or assessment modifications.
