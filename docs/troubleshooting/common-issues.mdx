## Application Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="EdgeFlow won't launch">
    **Symptoms**: Application doesn't open, crashes immediately, or shows error on startup.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Restart your computer** and try again
    2. **Check system requirements** - ensure your OS version is supported
    3. **On macOS**: Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper
    4. **Reinstall** the application from a fresh download
    5. **Check console logs** for error messages (macOS: Console.app, Windows: Event Viewer)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forgot database password">
    **Symptoms**: Cannot access EdgeFlow data after entering wrong password.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check saved password**: On macOS, look in Keychain Access for "EdgeFlow"
    2. **Try variations**: Check for caps lock, common password variations
    3. **Restore from backup**: If you have unencrypted exports, you can reimport data into a fresh database

    <Warning>
    If you cannot recover the password and have no backups, the encrypted data cannot be retrieved.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Application is slow or unresponsive">
    **Symptoms**: Lag when navigating, slow session loading, delayed responses.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Close other applications** to free memory
    2. **Optimize database**: Settings > Data Management > Optimize Database
    3. **Check database size**: Very large databases (10,000+ sessions) may benefit from archiving old data
    4. **Disable animations**: Settings > Display > Reduce Motion
    5. **Restart EdgeFlow** to clear cached data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data not saving">
    **Symptoms**: Sessions complete but don't appear in history, settings don't persist.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check disk space**: Ensure sufficient storage available
    2. **Verify permissions**: EdgeFlow needs write access to its data directory
    3. **Avoid network drives**: Store database on local disk
    4. **Check antivirus**: Some antivirus software may block database writes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Hardware Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Arduino not detected">
    **Symptoms**: Serial port dropdown is empty or Arduino doesn't appear.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check USB connection**: Try different port and cable
    2. **Install drivers**:
       - Windows: Install Arduino USB drivers
       - Linux: Add user to `dialout` group
    3. **Close other apps**: Arduino IDE or serial monitors may block the port
    4. **Restart EdgeFlow** after connecting hardware
    5. **Try different USB cable**: Some cables are power-only
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Force readings are always zero">
    **Symptoms**: Connected successfully but force never changes from 0.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check sensor wiring**: Verify all connections match documentation
    2. **Verify firmware**: Ensure correct firmware is uploaded
    3. **Recalibrate**: Run calibration procedure from Settings > Hardware
    4. **Test with Arduino IDE**: Open Serial Monitor to check raw output
    5. **Check HX711 power**: Ensure amplifier has proper 5V supply
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Force readings are erratic or noisy">
    **Symptoms**: Values jump around, spikes, or seem unstable.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check mechanical connections**: Tighten all screws and mounts
    2. **Inspect wiring**: Look for loose or frayed connections
    3. **Use shielded cables**: Reduce electrical interference
    4. **Isolate power supply**: Use separate power for Arduino if needed
    5. **Add filtering**: Firmware may need smoothing adjustments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection drops during session">
    **Symptoms**: Hardware disconnects mid-session, data collection stops.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Use direct USB connection**: Avoid USB hubs
    2. **Shorter cable**: Use shortest cable that reaches
    3. **Disable USB sleep**: Prevent OS from suspending USB ports
    4. **Check power**: Ensure adequate power supply to Arduino
    5. **Secure connections**: Prevent cable movement during session
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Session Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Session won't start">
    **Symptoms**: Equipment checklist fails, start button disabled.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check all checklist items**: Address any red/yellow indicators
    2. **Verify stimulus set**: Ensure set contains exactly 5 stimuli
    3. **Reconnect hardware**: For conjugate sessions, verify Arduino connection
    4. **Close other sessions**: Only one active session allowed at a time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Participant window doesn't open">
    **Symptoms**: Session starts but only researcher monitor appears.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check display settings**: Verify participant display is configured
    2. **Look on other monitor**: Window may have opened on secondary display
    3. **Reset window position**: Settings > Display > Reset Window Positions
    4. **Restart EdgeFlow** and try again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session data is incomplete">
    **Symptoms**: Some trials missing, partial data recorded.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check session status**: Incomplete sessions have partial data by design
    2. **Review during session**: Monitor for connection drops during assessment
    3. **Verify storage**: Ensure disk space was available during session
    4. **Check logs**: Settings > Advanced > View Logs for errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keyboard shortcuts not working">
    **Symptoms**: Number keys or other shortcuts don't register selections.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Focus correct window**: Click on participant window first
    2. **Check keyboard layout**: Ensure expected layout is active
    3. **Disable system shortcuts**: Some OS shortcuts may conflict
    4. **Use mouse clicks** as alternative during session
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Display Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stimuli appear cut off or stretched">
    **Symptoms**: Images don't display correctly, appear distorted.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check original image dimensions**: Use square or consistent aspect ratios
    2. **Adjust display size**: Settings > Display > Stimulus Display Size
    3. **Verify file format**: Use PNG or JPG for best compatibility
    4. **Re-upload stimulus**: Delete and re-add if corruption suspected
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Text is too small or large">
    **Symptoms**: Interface text difficult to read.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Adjust font size**: Settings > Display > Font Size
    2. **Enable high contrast**: Settings > Display > High Contrast Mode
    3. **Check system scaling**: OS display scaling may affect EdgeFlow
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dark mode not working">
    **Symptoms**: Theme doesn't change when system changes.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Set explicit theme**: Settings > Display > Theme (Light/Dark instead of System)
    2. **Restart EdgeFlow** after changing system theme
    3. **Check OS version**: System theme detection requires recent OS versions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Export Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Export file is empty or corrupted">
    **Symptoms**: Downloaded file has no data or won't open.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check session status**: Incomplete sessions may have limited data
    2. **Try different format**: Export as JSON if CSV fails, or vice versa
    3. **Export single session**: Test with one session before batch export
    4. **Check disk space**: Ensure room for export file
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Export takes very long">
    **Symptoms**: Large exports seem to hang or take excessive time.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Reduce scope**: Export smaller date ranges
    2. **Disable raw force data**: Uncheck "Include raw force data" option
    3. **Export in batches**: Split large exports into multiple files
    4. **Wait patiently**: Large exports with force samples can take minutes
